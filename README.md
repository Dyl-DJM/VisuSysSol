# VisuSysSol
3D Simulation of the Solar system


## Compilation of the simulation

Open a terminal and go to the root of the project (where we can find this README).

Then run the following command lines

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

## Run the simulation

From the root of the project, you need to run the executable file located in the bin directory

From the root you can run

```
./bin/SolarSys_
```

From the buil folder

```
./../bin/SolarSys_
```
